        <p>Tap and drag to scrub through the video's frames.  Scrubbing is quadratic - the farther you drag the faster it flips through frames.</p>
        <p>Tap the edges of the screen to manually flip to the next frame.</p>
        <h1>Capture List</h1>
        <p>If a capture is deleted, its associated mark metadata is deleted too.</p>
        <p>The mark database can be retrieved from the device via iOS File Sharing.  Plug the device into a Mac, click the device in Finder, select Is It Snappy?, and copy snappy-database.json to your computer.</p>
